# RID Hijacking: Maintaining Access on Windows Machines

The **RID Hijacking** hook, applicable to all Windows versions, allows setting desired privileges to an existent account in a stealthy manner by modifying some security attributes of an user.

By only using OS resources, it is possible to replace the RID of an user right before the primary access token is created, allowing to spoof the privileges of the hijacked RID owner.
